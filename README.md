# HadesUILib (WIP)
A WIP for making many Ui elements easily available to modders through lua
# Documentation
Check the wiki tab for documentation on sliders and dropdowns

# TODO:
* Dropdown Menus
* On-screen Keyboard (OSK)
  * Modifibale size
  * Able to disable input when opened or not (and then reenable if it disabled it)
* Text fields using the OSK
* With OSK an entire lua side debug menu ex: a cheat menu, text-based commands for dialogue???? custom viewing (Very iffy)
* Radial Menus (Menu only, overlays later as that could be confusing with input handling)
* Slider dragging: Sliding turned on when clicked, follows mouse until mouse clicked again to turn mouse follow off
* Creating Sub-menus that dont re-enable input on close, effectively making in menu pop-up systems
